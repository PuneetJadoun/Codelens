🚀 AlgoVisualizer

A modern, interactive web application for understanding Data Structures and Algorithms through real-time visualizations. This project helps learners explore how sorting, searching, graph traversal, and other algorithms work step-by-step with clean animations and intuitive controls.

🔍 Overview

AlgoVisualizer is built to make algorithm learning simple, visual, and engaging. Instead of reading long code samples or imagining how an algorithm behaves internally, this tool shows the entire process visually with real-time updates and animations.

It is ideal for:

Students learning DSA

Developers brushing up core concepts

Learners preparing for coding interviews

Anyone who prefers learning through visuals
